# Prepend a string before each line in a variable.  Also converts all newlines
# to Unix-style newlines in case they weren't that way before.
#
# $1 - Name of variable where the result will be stored.
# $2 - Prefix string to add to the beginning of all lines.
# $3 - The original string.
#
# Example:
#
#   printf -v lines "one\ntwo\n"
#   # lines is three lines with nothing on the third line.
#
#   string::prefixLines result "Look:  " "$lines"
#   # Result is "Look:  one\nLook:  two\nLook:  "
#   # Even the last line is (intentionally) prefixed.
#
# Returns nothing.
